            Artem was a raccoon with a taste for the extreme. While his brethren
            were content to topple a garbage can for a meal, Artem sought
            the thrill of the chase. His arena was the city’s underbelly, his
            surfboard a discarded pantry door, and his ocean the surging sewer
            runoff after a storm.

            He carved a hard left around a moss-covered bend, the roar
            of the water his soundtrack. But then, a new aroma sliced through
            the damp, metallic air. It wasn’t the usual sewer-stench. It was
            rich, smoky, and deeply, wonderfully greasy. It was the smell
            of home.

            Drifting into a wider cavern, his eyes adjusted to a soft,
            flickering light. It came from a rusted dumpster, tipped on its side
            like a metal cave. And there, bathed in its warm glow, was the most
            magnificent creature he had ever laid eyes on.

            She was a possum, her fur the color of ash and moonlight. With
            an artist’s focus, she tended to her roast, turning it slowly to get
            the perfect char. She hadn’t just found dinner; she had created
            a dining experience.

            Artem’s heart, usually a frantic drum of adrenaline, skipped a beat
            and started a whole new rhythm. He forgot the current, his board,
            and his own name. He just floated there, mesmerized by this queen
            of the discarded, this master of the thrown-away feast.

            He decided to make an entrance. A cool, casual glide to her little
            shore. But his eyes were so fixed on her that he didn't see
            the swirl of current ahead. The door tipped, and Artem went down
            with a loud, graceless SPLOOSH.

            The possum looked up from her cooking. She wasn’t startled
            or scared. A slow, knowing smile spread across her face, and her
            dark eyes danced with amusement in the firelight.

            A drenched and deeply embarrassed raccoon head broke the surface.
            “Da, is very smooth, no?” Artem sputtered, trying to slick his fur
            back. “Just, uh… parking my ride.”

            She let out a soft, raspy chuckle. “Ay, chiquito, you look like you
            could use something to warm you up.” She held out the stick. “I’m
            Margarita. And this is just about ready. There’s enough for two.”

            And so, in the warm glow of a dumpster fire, deep beneath
            the sleeping city, a sewer-surfing raccoon and a gourmet possum
            shared a perfect meal. It was the beginning of their story, a love
            founded on the beautiful treasures others threw away.
