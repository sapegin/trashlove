00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The trash animal tango

00:04.500 --> 00:13.000
Artem was a raccoon with a taste for the extreme. While his brethren were content to topple a garbage can for a meal,

00:13.500 --> 00:22.000
Artem sought the thrill of the chase. His arena was the city's underbelly, his surfboard a discarded pantry door,

00:22.500 --> 00:28.000
and his ocean the surging sewer runoff after a storm.

00:28.500 --> 00:37.000
He carved a hard left around a moss-covered bend, the roar of the water his soundtrack. But then, a new aroma sliced through

00:37.500 --> 00:46.000
the damp, metallic air. It wasn't the usual sewer-stench. It was rich, smoky, and deeply, wonderfully greasy.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.000
It was the smell of home.

00:50.500 --> 00:59.000
Drifting into a wider cavern, his eyes adjusted to a soft, flickering light. It came from a rusted dumpster,

00:59.500 --> 01:08.000
tipped on its side like a metal cave. And there, bathed in its warm glow, was the most magnificent creature

01:08.500 --> 01:12.000
he had ever laid eyes on.

01:12.500 --> 01:21.000
She was a possum, her fur the color of ash and moonlight. With an artist's focus, she tended to her roast,

01:21.500 --> 01:30.000
turning it slowly to get the perfect char. She hadn't just found dinner; she had created a dining experience.

01:30.500 --> 01:39.000
Artem's heart, usually a frantic drum of adrenaline, skipped a beat and started a whole new rhythm.

01:39.500 --> 01:48.000
He forgot the current, his board, and his own name. He just floated there, mesmerized by this queen

01:48.500 --> 01:54.000
of the discarded, this master of the thrown-away feast.

01:54.500 --> 02:03.000
He decided to make an entrance. A cool, casual glide to her little shore. But his eyes were so fixed on her

02:03.500 --> 02:12.000
that he didn't see the swirl of current ahead. The door tipped, and Artem went down with a loud, graceless

02:12.500 --> 02:15.000
SPLOOSH.

02:15.500 --> 02:24.000
The possum looked up from her cooking. She wasn't startled or scared. A slow, knowing smile spread across her face,

02:24.500 --> 02:30.000
and her dark eyes danced with amusement in the firelight.

02:30.500 --> 02:39.000
A drenched and deeply embarrassed raccoon head broke the surface. "Da, is very smooth, no?"

02:39.500 --> 02:46.000
Artem sputtered, trying to slick his fur back. "Just, uh… parking my ride."

02:46.500 --> 02:55.000
She let out a soft, raspy chuckle. "Ay, chiquito, you look like you could use something to warm you up."

02:55.500 --> 03:04.000
She held out the stick. "I'm Margarita. And this is just about ready. There's enough for two."

03:04.500 --> 03:13.000
And so, in the warm glow of a dumpster fire, deep beneath the sleeping city, a sewer-surfing raccoon

03:13.500 --> 03:22.000
and a gourmet possum shared a perfect meal. It was the beginning of their story,

03:22.500 --> 03:30.000
a love founded on the beautiful treasures others threw away.
